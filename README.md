# Basic ChatBot integration with FaceBook
This code has been a simple poc to check wheather we can achieve chatbot like service with less to no training required and can 
build purely on word based intent finding and regex based or pos and noun-chunk based entities recognition.

__Note__: As i am able to build *advance version of bot with ML/DL*, I feel it could give a introduction to newbee for a chatbot development

## Steps to get you started
1) > git clone https://github.com/avi0gaur/FbMessengerBot.git

2) > pip install -r requirements.txt

3) > python app.py
The end url would be *http://<your ip>/fbbot*
